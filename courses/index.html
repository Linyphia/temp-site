    <p>
      I first came to the
      <a href="http://flbs.umt.edu/" target="_blank">Flathead Lake Biological Station</a>
      in 1980, when I took my first serious course in animal behavior, taught by
      <a href="https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv30462" target="_blank">
        <strong>Alan W. Stokes</strong>
      </a>
      of Utah State University. Alan was a widely respected animal behaviorist who taught
      at the station for many summers, with his wife <strong>Alice Stokes</strong> by his side,
      and that course marked the beginning of what became a long-term research program on
      the sexual selection system of the Sierra Dome spider—work that continues to this day.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1994, I began teaching <em>Field Studies in the Evolution of Animal Behavior</em> at the
      station. Over the years that followed, the course was offered roughly every other
      summer, concluding with its final offering in 2025. Being able to combine teaching
      with continued, intensive field research was one of the great privileges of my
      professional life.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am deeply grateful to the station for making this work possible, and equally grateful
      to the students who chose to spend their summers there. They added more to my life
      than they likely realized at the time.
    </p>

      Field days were long. Learning happened in conversations, in silence, in motion,
      and sometimes in simply being present long enough to notice what was already there.
