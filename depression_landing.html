        <h1 class="page-title"><span class="t1">Rethinking Depression:</span><br><span class="t2">From Malfunction to Social Navigation?</span></h1>

        <p>The Social Navigation / Niche Change Hypothesis (SNH) proposes that some episodes of severe depression are not simply breakdowns of mood control, but a risky, high-gain mode of mood regulation sometimes recruited when a person is trapped in an untenable social niche and ordinary negotiation has failed.</p>

        <p>SNH is not a claim that “depression is good for you,” or that all low mood or major depressive disorder is adaptive. Many depressive episodes are likely misfires, driven primarily by illness, drugs, neurodegeneration, or modern evolutionary mismatch. The hypothesis is intentionally narrow. It targets a specific class of depressive episodes that may nevertheless be surprisingly common in both traditional human societies and modern social ecologies.</p>
		
		<p>At its core, SNH starts from a simple but uncomfortable observation:
		    many of the hardest problems in human life are not technical or personal, but deeply social. They involve distributed obligations,power asymmetries, reputation, and stalled negotiations with multiple partners at once. In those situations, “trying harder,” thinking more positively, or making small concessions often does nothing to move the system.</p>

        <p>SNH proposes that both minor depressive states and a particular high-gain depressive mode are sometimes recruited under three conditions:</p>

        <img class="float-art" src="starry_night.jpg" alt="Starry Night" loading="lazy" />

        <ul>
          <li>Non-point-source entrapment — being stuck in a web of obligations and vetoes enforced by multiple partners, rather than a single villain or decision-maker.</li>
          <li>A better niche is visible but blocked — a realistically better life configuration is in sight, but cannot be reached without cooperation from others.</li>
          <li>Ordinary bargaining has failed — requests, compromises, and incremental adjustments have already proven ineffective.</li>
        </ul>

		<p>Under these conditions, depression may function as a drastic way of interrupting “business as usual”: concentrating attention, withdrawing from unworkable roles, making distress visible, and forcing the surrounding social environment to register that something must change.</p>
		
		<p>Crucially, SNH does not assume that the human mind is designed to represent reality accurately in all circumstances. Like other evolved systems, human cognition operates through an adaptively subjective model of the world—one tuned for action, negotiation, and survival rather than veridical truth for its own sake. On this view, depressive states involve a selective reconfiguration of that subjective world model under extreme social constraint.</p>

		<p>Although depressive states are dynamically tuned to a person’s socioecological context, they are not free-form. SNH predicts a constrained, repeatable structure in how cognition, motivation, and social sensitivity shift—precisely what allows the hypothesis to be tested and potentially falsified.</p>

		<p>This project is a theory-driven effort. The essays collected here are written to do two things at once: to make the underlying ideas accessible to an educated general audience, and to invite serious empirical scrutiny from researchers in psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, anthropology, and related fields.</p>

        <p>SNH is therefore a testable evolutionary model. This site lays out the hypothesis, its limits, and a research agenda designed to either support it — or falsify it — by confronting its predictions head-on using informed, substantive methodologies rather than proxy measures or overly coarse categories.</p>

		<p>For example, the hypothesis predicts that in true socioeconomic entrapment depressions, symptom remission should track documented concessions, exits, or binding partner commitments that alter the underlying constraint structure more closely than it tracks time, generic support, or medication alone. It also predicts distinctive patterns of effort, motivation, and social discrimination that can be checked against real data — especially in longitudinal and network-sensitive designs.</p>
		
		<p>This project is presented in three parts:</p>
		<ul>
          <li>The Positive Case — a clear statement of the Social Navigation / Niche Change Hypothesis and the logic behind it.</li>
          <li>Critiques and Responses — a careful engagement with objections, misunderstandings, and alternative explanations.</li>
          <li>Tests — an empiricist’s guide to how the hypothesis could be rigorously evaluated or shown to be wrong.</li>
        </ul>
		
		<p>Most readers should start with the Positive Case Essay, even if you think you already understand SNH or related evolutionary accounts of depression. The later essays assume that particular framing. The Tests Essay is written especially for empiricists and clinicians who want to know exactly what kinds of data, designs, and outcomes would count against the hypothesis.</p>
		
		<p>A note on authorship and perspective. The Social Navigation Hypothesis did not emerge in isolation. Its early development involved close collaboration with several colleagues, whose empirical and theoretical work has continued to shape the research literature over the past two decades. While many of those collaborators have carried forward empirical programs related to the hypothesis, I have continued to focus primarily on its conceptual structure, scope, and implications.</p>
		
		<p>The essays presented here build directly on that shared foundation. They engage extensively with the published work of those colleagues — work that is acknowledged and examined throughout. At the same time, these essays represent my personal synthesis of the Social Navigation / Niche Change framework as I understand it today, roughly twenty-five years after its initial formulation. They should therefore be read not as a consensus statement, but as a current, theory-driven articulation offered for scrutiny, testing, and revision.</p>

		<p>If you’re curious about why we are suseptible to depression, possibly as something <em>more</em> than a malfunction but less than a romanticized insight, then this is a place to start.</p>
