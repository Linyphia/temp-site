      <h2>Independent Study Research Invitation – Summer 2026</h2>

      <p>I am seeking one or two independent study students for the summer of 2026 to work with me for 8 weeks or more at 
      <a href="https://flbs.umt.edu/newflbs/">Flathead Lake Biological Station</a>. I have had many fine assistants over the years 
      helping me study the Sierra Dome Spider. But now, I am looking for individuals who, in addition to wanting a grad school prep research experience, 
      could seriously consider continuing the deep study of the Sierra Dome spider’s sexual selection system as a central part of their
      life’s work, as I have done. In other words, at the age of 68, still healthy and loving the work, I am looking for a scientific heir.</p>

      <p>There is massive opportunity available to the right person to continue studying this amazing model system long-term:
      solidifying and expanding behavioral observations (including female-specific sperm utilization patterns),
      adding new research elements needed to fully characterize the complexity of this mating system and to elucidate its evolution.</p>

      <p>My emphasis now, since 2024, is documenting not just species-typical patterns of intra- and intersexual behaviors,
      but also the diverse ways that individuals of both sexes develop to optimize both mind and body in an integrated way 
      for playing the mating game.</p>

      <p>There is also potential for a wide range of not just relevant but essential molecular biological investigations — for example,
      exploring how rickettsial diseases have affected the evolution of the mating system and individual development,
      and how microbiomes and their interactions with genotypes and gene expression patterns influence individual developmental optimizations —
      how everything from genes to microbes shapes the “personality development” of individual spiders in ecological time.</p>

      <p>As part of this offer, I seek coauthors to assist me in publishing a considerable backlog of material — 
      ranging from copious raw data (e.g., on individual variation in courtship energetics) to almost completed manuscripts. 
      I would only claim secondary or last authorship.</p>

      <p>It is exceedingly rare to find a complex sexual selection system so fantastically observable and manipulable
      in both the field and the lab: Consider letting me show YOU the ropes and hand off this stunning model study system
      to YOU, young investigator. Time is limited. I have limited but appreciable funds to help support you
      as you join me in continuing this unusually long-term and in-depth research.</p>

      <p>Dr. Paul J. Watson is Associate Professor of Biology at the University of New Mexico and a Faculty Affiliate of the Flathead Lake Biological Station in northwestern Montana, where he has worked since 1980. Over decades, he has taught animal behavior courses and conducted long-term research on the Sierra Dome spider’s sexual selection system, as well as many other shorter-term studies. The extensive background dataset collected on the Sierra Dome, together with many other features of this spider species, not least its exceptional observability and manipulability in field and lab, offers future investigators a uniquely powerful foundation for asking truly cutting-edge questions of broad interest about the evolution of this species’ behavior.</p>

      <h2>Spring 2026 – BIOL 419/519 Section 2: The Evolution of Religiosity and Human Coalitional Psychology</h2>

      <p>This is a <strong>three-credit-hour</strong> seminar offered through the Department of Biology and cross-listed as 
      <strong>Psychology 450</strong> and <strong>Religious Studies 447</strong>. The course examines the evolutionary origins and adaptive significance 
      of religiosity and human coalitionary psychology, exploring how deeply rooted cognitive and emotional systems shape human 
      spirituality, moral reasoning, and group behavior.</p>

      <p><strong>Meeting Schedule:</strong> Tuesdays and Thursdays, 11:00 a.m. – 12:15 p.m.<br>
      <strong>Location:</strong> Room 258, Castetter Hall (Biology Building).</p>

      <p><strong>Enrollment Details:</strong> Maximum enrollment is 22 students. Admission is by <em>permission of instructor only</em>. 
      Interested students should contact Dr. Watson by email (<a href="mailto:pwatson@unm.edu">pwatson@unm.edu</a>) 
      to arrange a brief conversation—by phone or in person—prior to receiving permission to enroll.</p>

      <p><strong>Course Description:</strong><br>
      Now entering its 17th edition, this unique evolutionary psychology seminar investigates both the evolutionary origins and potential 
      adaptive significance of cross-cultural, species-typical aspects of religious experience, belief, and practice. The course is a science 
      seminar that also encourages evolutionarily informed introspection and self-discovery. It is <em>not</em> an assault on religious belief 
      but an exploration of how far we can go using modern Darwinian and Hamiltonian evolutionary theory to understand our powerful but 
      contingent spiritual drives.</p>
