  <h2>Primary Research Program:<br>The Sierra Dome Spider (<I>Neriene litigiosa</I>: Linyphiidae)</h2>

  <p>For more than four decades I have used the Sierra Dome spider as a field and laboratory system for studying the fitness effects of 
  mate and sire selection by females, the functions of polyandry, and how sexual
  selection shapes and maintains the development of individual differences in morphology, physiology, and behavior. These highly observable spiders live in
  accessible webs, exhibit dramatic courtship and male-male contest rituals, and show significant size, lifespan, and complex behavioral variation 
  among individuals — features that make them ideal for connecting developmental biology to evolutionary theory.</p>

  <p>The central question guiding my current work is <strong>how male and female spiders develop combinations of traits that together
  maximize lifetime mating and fertilization success</strong>. In males, this means exploring how physical and physiological
  condition, immune competence, disease exposure, and experience interact to produce distinctive <em>behavioral
  “personalities.”</em> Females are sequentially polyandrous by nature and have two different mate selection mechanisms, one 
  for first mates and another for, typically, 1 to 3 seconday mates. Although males are dominant, females completely control whether 
  mating occurs, and they can decide the proportion of of each male's ejaculate they allow into their pool of stored sperm for later use in fertilizing eggs.</p>
  
  <p>Females may seek a form of nonrandom limited strategic diversity amongst the males that sire their offfspring. 
  Moreover, the proportion of each male type that is optimal may vary amongst females and may shift year by year. 
  Complex and dynamic female choice likely provides part of the selective context in which a degree of fascinating 
  diversity of male sexual strategies and corresponding physical and personality profiles is maintained. Another factor 
  is yearly variation in the virulence of two rickettsial diseases that affect both sexes of the spider.</p>
  
  <p>I cannot over-emphasize what a fine model system this species is for deep sexual selection studies and, in spite of the large amount of background information 
  on the system I have gathered since 1980, how much more there is to be discovered through continued observation and the use of modern technologies, 
  including molecular genetics. Many questions of theoretical interest are not mentioned here - let me tell you about them! <strong>I am incredibly eager 
  to support an avid and capable young investigator interested in continuing research on the Sierra Dome 
  spider</strong> as a major component of their career in evolutionary behavioral ecology.</p>
