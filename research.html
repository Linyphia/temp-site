  <h2>Primary Research Program: The Sierra Dome Spider (Neriene litigiosa)</h2>

  <p>For more than four decades I have used the Sierra Dome spider as a field and laboratory system for studying how sexual
  selection shapes the development of individual differences in morphology, physiology, and behavior. These spiders live in
  accessible webs, exhibit dramatic courtship rituals, and show consistent variation among individuals‚Äîfeatures that make
  them ideal for connecting developmental biology to evolutionary theory.</p>

  <p>The central question guiding this work is <strong>how male and female spiders develop combinations of traits that together
  maximize lifetime mating and fertilization success</strong>. In males, this means exploring how physical and physiological
  condition, immune competence, disease exposure, and experience interact to produce distinctive <em>behavioral
  ‚Äúpersonalities.‚Äù</em> Females, sequentially polyandrous by nature, provide the ecological and sexual context in which this
  diversity of male strategies is maintained.</p>

  <h3>Integrative development of male Sierra Dome spiders</h3>

  <p>Our current emphasis is on <strong>individual development in males</strong>‚Äîthe way that body form, physiological state, and
  behavior are integrated through development to produce coordinated mating strategies. Each male can be viewed as a dynamic
  system in which multiple traits‚Äîsize, endurance, stridulation vigor, web use, risk taking, and immune profile‚Äîco-evolve
  and co-adjust to one another. Selection favors combinations of traits that work well together rather than extremes of any
  single feature.</p>

  <p>This approach treats ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù not as a metaphor but as a quantifiable, integrative phenotype: a repeatable
  configuration of physical, physiological, and behavioral traits that together influence reproductive success. We ask how
  these configurations arise during juvenile development and how environmental variables such as food, temperature,
  parasites, and social encounters bias the trajectory toward one or another mature strategy.</p>

  <h3>Guarding and associative behavior in penultimate females</h3>

    <em>Penultimate female Sierra Dome spider guarded by a mature male, showing associative behavior
    (<a href="Watson_1990_Associative_Behavior.pdf" target="_blank">see&nbsp;Watson&nbsp;1990</a>).</em>
  </p>

  <p class="photo-note">
    In the associative phase, a penultimate female remains close to a visiting male in the center of her dome,
    eliciting multi-day guarding attempts that never occur with avoidant or mature females. Each arriving male
    fights to replace the current guard, generating a sequence of contests that ends when the female molts and
    mates immediately with the final resident‚Äîthe ‚Äúchampion‚Äù male. This female-initiated dynamic, described in
    <a href="Watson_1990_Associative_Behavior.pdf" target="_blank">Watson&nbsp;1990</a>,
    illustrates how associative behavior enhances male‚Äìmale competition and secures a high-quality first mate.
    Current work examines a rapid ‚Äúskipping‚Äù display by associative females that may intensify these combats.

  <h3>Laser vibrometry of web-borne signals</h3>

  <p>In 2024 we began using <strong>laser vibrometry</strong> to record, in unprecedented detail, the vibratory signals that
  males and females send to one another through their webs. The technique captures every major style of
  strumming and vibration involved in both male‚Äìmale contests and male‚Äìfemale interactions, including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Abdominal twitching</li>
    <li>Pedipalp twitching</li>
    <li>Male four-legged pre-copulatory web-strumming</li>
    <li>Female skipping</li>
    <li>Female two-legged web-strumming</li>
    <li>Female web-pulling and shaking</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These high-resolution recordings allow us to compare individual males much as one might compare musicians performing the
  same piece‚Äîeach male produces the basic pattern, but with subtle differences in rhythm, intensity, and phrasing that
  reflect his internal state and strategy. We are now quantifying how these signal ‚Äústyles‚Äù correlate with body condition,
  age, disease exposure, and ultimately mating and fertilization success.</p>

  <p>Laser vibrometry provides a new, fine-grained window into how <strong>individual personality development is linked to mating
  strategy</strong> and will become a major tool for the next phase of this long-term study.</p>
