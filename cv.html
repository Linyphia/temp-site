  <p>Much of my research has been self-funded, with strong support from my wife, Maria O‚ÄôBrien, whom I met at Flathead Biological Station in 1985, as well as other private sources.</p>
  <h2>Current Teaching</h2>

  <p>
    I currently serve on three graduate committees across the Biology and Psychology departments at UNM and participate in Dr. Kelly Miller‚Äôs lab group.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The Evolution of Religiosity and Human Coalitional Psychology.</strong><br>
    An upper-division/graduate seminar (3 credits), cross-listed in Biology, Psychology, Religious Studies, and Peace Studies. Taught regularly since 1990. The 17th edition is scheduled for Spring 2026.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Field Studies in the Evolution of Animal Behavior.</strong><br>
    Last taught Summer 2025 at Flathead Lake Biological Station. The course emphasizes practical research and hypothesis-driven fieldwork. In 2026, I‚Äôm still accepting independent study students for summer sessions at FLBS.
  </p>

  <p>
    In its 4- and 8-week versions, this course trains students in data collection, Darwinian theory, hypothesis testing, and writing. Students in the 4-week version may extend for 2 weeks to earn independent study credit.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The Evolution of Depression.</strong><br>
    Last taught Fall 2015. Seminar critically examines adaptationist models of unipolar depression, including my ‚ÄúSocial Navigation / Niche Change‚Äù hypothesis. Planned expansion into a large-enrollment course and book project.
  </p>

  <p>
    My courses emphasize deep understanding of modern Darwinism (including the ‚Äúsecond Darwinian revolution‚Äù and the ‚Äúextended synthesis‚Äù), critical engagement with evolutionary ideas, personal self-observation, collaboration, and clear writing.
  </p>

  <p>
    I regularly give invited public talks (e.g., OASIS, NM Center for Science and Reason) and guest lectures (e.g., Dr. Donna Ray‚Äôs Theories of Religion, REL 452). I‚Äôve discussed unipolar depression on Joe Alcock‚Äôs Evo Med podcast and presented at ISEMPH 2018. Most recently, I delivered five hours of lectures on Sierra dome spiders in Dr. Kelly Miller‚Äôs "Animal Sexual Strategies" course and gave a guest talk in Dr. Tania Reynolds‚Äôs ‚ÄúEvolutionary Psychology and Social Issues‚Äù seminar.
  </p>

  <h2>Past Teaching</h2>

  <p>
    I‚Äôve taught more than 22 upper-division and graduate seminars since 1991 on evolutionary behavioral ecology, often with Dr. Randy Thornhill or Dr. Steven Gangestad.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Field Studies in Animal Behavior</strong><br>
    8-week intensive course at Flathead Lake Biological Station for undergrads and early grads. Focus on Darwinian field methods, quantitative hypothesis testing, and scientific writing. Taught ~8 times. Also covered local species beyond the Sierra dome.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Evolutionary Psychology and Spirituality</strong><br>
    Presented in contemplative groups (e.g., Gurdjieff Foundation in NY, London, NM), using evolutionary psych as a tool for inner self-objectivity and inquiry.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The Evolution of Human Sexuality</strong><br>
    Covered for Dr. Thornhill in the early 1990s. Large lecture format; I attended this course often as a participant and later served as substitute lecturer.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Evolutionary Psychology and Psychotherapy Workshops</strong><br>
    ~5 total, co-led with Gestalt therapist John D. Wymore. Delivered at Esalen and elsewhere. Designed for mental health professionals to engage with evolutionary psychology in clinical work.
  </p>

  <h2>Current Research</h2>

  <p>
    Ongoing field and lab studies of the Sierra dome spider sexual selection system at Flathead Lake Biological Station. Current foci:
    <ul>
      <li>Manipulative, honest-vague signaling by females</li>
      <li>Copulatory courtship energetics (CO‚ÇÇ respirometry)</li>
      <li>Sexually antagonistic genes and disease/lifespan/behavioral evolution</li>
      <li>eDNA-PCR and metagenomics: how microbiomes shape mate choice</li>
    </ul>
    Main emphasis: male personality development matched to female preference strategies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Human lab research tests the Parasite Stress Hypothesis vs. my Informational Boundaries Hypothesis for religiosity using data from 537 subjects. Developing a novel evolutionary explanation for the placebo effect based on honest signaling and commitment theory ‚Äî with implications for compassionate care.
  </p>

  <h2>Other Professional Activities</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Mentored 11+ graduate and 35+ undergrad researchers (including many independent study credits). Most mentoring unpaid. Co-mentored with Drs. Thornhill, Kelly Miller, and David Witherington.</li>
    <li>Co-led advanced seminars at UNM for decades (mostly unpaid).</li>
    <li>Associate Editor, Frontiers in Evolutionary Psychology and Neuroscience. Frequent reviewer for peer journals.</li>
    <li>Co-author of 2002 adaptationist theory of depression with Dr. Paul Andrews; working on a public-facing book to drive clinical trials and wider recognition.</li>
    <li>Member: Animal Behavior Society, Human Behavior & Evolution Society (HBES), AAAS.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Publications</h2>

  <p class="caption">Dr. Watson atop the FJ60 watchtower: a reflective moment while observing a live-trapping operation of Columbian ground squirrels (2018). 
    Captured individuals were used in an elaborate soft release program to restore the Flathead Lake Biostation's population, extirpated by a bloodthirsty 
    family of mink in the early 2000's. The restoration effort was successful, with new pup's of several females emerging in the spring of 2019.
